# ns3_gazebo

Simulated Wifi, simulated physics, real autonomy.

* Simulated Wifi network via the ns-3 Network Simulator.
* Simulated physics via Gazebo 9.
* Real autonomy via ROS2.

This repository provides setup scripts and code for simulating distributed software.

Although intended for ROS2, ns3_gazebo has application in any domain where nodes must communicate with each other over Wifi while communicating with a central process using direct network communication.
